# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Assign the two points to variables between which the distance is to be calculated
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance using format function
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```


### OUTPUT:
